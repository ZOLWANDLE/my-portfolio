    <p>I am Nangamso Duma, a 23 year old aspiring frontend developer |UI/UX designer. I began my<br>
        journey of falling in love with design during college.  During my qualification, I got the chance<br> to be 
        exposed to many divisions within IT, from cybersecurity to information systems to systems support,<br>
        I did it all, but I ended up falling in love with the creativity side of IT.<br><br>
        
        From a young age, I have been captivated by the intersection of technology and creativity. The ability<br>
        to craft intuitive user interfaces and bring designs to life through code has always fascinated me. <br>
        Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have continuously sought out opportunities to <br>
        enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of frontend development principles and best practices.<br><br>
        
        What motivates me most about frontend development is the opportunity to create meaningful <br>
        connections between users and digital products. Whether it's designing a seamless navigation <br>
        flow, optimizing performance for mobile devices, or incorporating interactive elements to enhance<br> 
        user engagement, I am constantly inspired by the potential to deliver intuitive and delightful <br>
        experiences that enrich people's lives.<br><br>
        
        Frontend development is a dynamic and ever-evolving field that presents endless opportunities<br> 
        for learning and growth. I am passionate about staying abreast of emerging <br>
        technologies and trends, and I thrive in environments where collaboration and i<br>nnovation 
        are valued. I am eager to leverage my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various <br>frontend 
        frameworks to tackle complex challenges and contribute to the success of your projects.<br><br>
        
        On top of my technical skills, I have a very strong work ethic, great attention to detail, and a <br>
        collaborative mindset. I am committed to delivering high-quality work that exceeds expectations<br>
        and drives measurable results. I am excited about making  a meaningful impact in the industry <br>
        through my contributions as a frontend developer.<br><br>
